The Damage Types is the way a player or mob takes damage.


Each Damage Type has weaknesses, so use it carefully.

;;;;;

There are three Damage Types:

- ![Bludgeoning](knightsheraldry:textures/overlay/bludgeoning_critical.png) Bludgeoning
- ![Slashing](knightsheraldry:textures/overlay/slashing_critical.png) Slashing
- ![Piercing](knightsheraldry:textures/overlay/piercing_critical.png) Piercing

The way that you can deal the damage that you want, depends on the weapon.
Inside each weapon page you can see how to deal it.
